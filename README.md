## GitHub Email Fetcher

> Find all email addresses for a GitHub user if they have them public.


This repo is a reproduction of [this repo](https://github.com/hamelsmu/pyscript-getemail) with:

1. [Flask + HTMX](./flask/)
2. [FastHTML](./fasthtml/)

The goal is to learn a little bit about FastHTML and see how it compares to building the same app in Flask + HTMX.
